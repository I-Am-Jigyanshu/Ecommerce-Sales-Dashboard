üõí E-commerce Sales Performance Dashboard
This project features an interactive sales performance dashboard built using Power BI for analyzing and tracking key metrics of an e-commerce platform across different regions, customer segments, and payment methods. The dashboard provides a snapshot of financial health and sales drivers for operational decision-making.

üéØ Key Metrics & Overview
The top-level KPIs immediately highlight the business scale and profitability:

Total Amount (69K): The sum of all sales revenue.

Total Quantity (1,157): The total number of items sold.

Total Profit (3,286): The overall profit generated by the sales.

Average Order Value (AOV) (21K): A key metric for assessing customer spend.

üìä Key Analytical Views
The dashboard is structured to drill down into operational performance and trends:

Geographical Sales Distribution: The Sum of Amount by State chart shows that Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are the leading states by sales volume, indicating primary market focus areas.

Payment Method Analysis: The Sum of Quantity by PaymentMode donut chart reveals that UPI (21%) is the most dominant payment method, followed by Debit Card (13%) and Credit Card (12%), which is crucial for optimizing payment gateway strategies.

Monthly Profit Trend: The Profit by Month visual reveals strong seasonal trends, with significant profit peaks in January, February, and December, but also indicates periods of losses/low profit during the mid-year months (e.g., July-September).

Customer & Category Insights:

Customer Performance: Sales are highly concentrated among top customers like Harivansh and Madhav, which is important for customer loyalty programs.

Category Performance: Clothing (14%) generates the highest quantity of sales, while the Sum of Profit by Sub-Category shows that Printers are the largest contributors to the bottom line, despite their low quantity share.
